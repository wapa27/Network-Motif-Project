Csima, Elizabeth. Determining If Two Graphs Are Isomorphic. University of Kentucky, 
www.ms.uky.edu/~csima/ma111/GraphsLecture2.pdf. 
	We used this lecture to help inform our algorithm’s ability to find and identify 
	isomorphisms. 

“Hamiltonian Cycle | Backtracking-6.” GeeksforGeeks, 4 Apr. 2019,
www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamiltonian-cycle-backtracking-6/. 
	We used this source to understand python implementation of hamiltonian cycles
	so we could sort the nodes in our motif by hamiltonian path or
	cycle (depending on the motif)

Hartke, Stephen G, and A J Radcliffe. “McKay’s Canonical Graph Labeling Algorithm.”
University of Michigan.
	We used this thesis to find out more about McKay’s tools and their use because
	McKay’s tools were mentioned in other resources. After learning more about their use
	and practical applications, we decided not to use McKay’s tools in our algorithm. 

Grochow, Joshua, and Manolis Kellis. “Network Motif Discovery Using Subgraph Enumeration
and Symmetry-Breaking.” Computer Science and AI Laboratory, M.I.T.
	We based the majority of our algorithm on the pseudocode and algorithm strategies
	suggested in this thesis, along with questions answered by Grochow himself. The most
	important thing we learned from this source is that symmetry-breaking is not required
	for correctness. 

mkrieger1. “‘Hamiltonian’ Path Using Python.” Stack Overflow, 27 Dec. 2017, 
stackoverflow.com/questions/47982604/hamiltonian-path-using-python. 
	We used code in a stack overflow response from mkrieger1 to find a hamiltonian 		path in our motif h. 

“Network Motif.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 14 Feb. 2019,
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_motif#Motif_Discovery_Algorithms. 
	We used Wikipedia as our first resource to become familiar with network motif
	finding strategies, existing algorithms, terminology, and the scope of the project.
